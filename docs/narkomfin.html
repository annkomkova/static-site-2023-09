The Museum team is studying both the architectural significance of the building and the life stories of its creators and inhabitants over a period of 100 years. The knowledge generated will form the basis of tour itineraries, publications, and various public and education projects constructed around this legendary building. In addition, residents of the building, Museum patrons, and GARAGE cardholders have access to Narkomfin Café, and a book shop has opened on the first floor of the residential block.</p><h2>History of the building</h2><p class="bold">The residential building created for staff of the Ministry of Finance of the RSFSR, which is now known as the Narkomfin Building, is one of the best-known experimental constructions in the USSR of the late 1920s and early 1930s.</p><p>The history of the building’s construction is closely connected with social processes taking place in the first decades of the USSR’s existence. Representatives of various professions were tasked with educating the new Soviet citizen, who would speak a new language, live according to the precepts of communism, and, as a result, become a true champion of its ideas. In architecture this led to the creation of house-communes and «transitional type» projects such as the Narkomfin Building. Laundry, childcare, and even residents’ leisure activities were all designed to take place in shared spaces and meals were to be served in a communal dining room.</p><p>However, the Narkomfin Building was famous not so much for its social concept as its unusual architectural solution.</p><p>The Narkomfin Building was based on designs for apartments developed by staff of the section for typifying residential accommodation of the Construction Committee (STROIKOM) of the RSFSR, headed by Moisei Ginzburg. The architect Alexander Pasternak, brother of the poet Boris Pasternak, became the lead staff member and a close associate of Ginzburg. He was the author of a series of projects for living cells, as compact apartments designed for various types of family were then called.</p></div><div id="visit" class="none"></div><div id="tours" class="none"></div><div id="cafe" class="none"></div><div id="bookshop" class="none"></div></div></div></body></html>
